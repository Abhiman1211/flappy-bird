# flappy-bird
This is a Falppy Bird game build using python.<br></br>
Click start or use your spacebar to get started. Fly the bird as far as you can without hitting a pipe.<br></br>

Steps to follow:<br></br>
1. Tap the arrow to start. Tap the space bar again to allow your bird to fly and to start the game.<br></br>
2. Stay in the middle of screen until the first set of pipes appears. Measure your tap heights to go between the two pipes.<br></br>
3. The faster you tap, the higher you go. Each tap represents a wing flap and higher flight. Once you stop, you drop towards the ground.<br></br> 
   Stay in the middle of the pipes. This is the main objective of the game. If you hit a pipe or the ground, the game ends.<br></br>
4. Try not to go high. You can still bump into a pipe.<br></br>
